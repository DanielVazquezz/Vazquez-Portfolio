ABOUT ME
I am a final-year student in a Double Degree in Finance & Accounting and Business Administration at the University of Málaga, with a GPA of 8.62/10. My academic path has given me a solid foundation in finance, accounting, valuation and business analysis.
Beyond academics, I have a strong entrepreneurial mindset. I enjoy building things from scratch, experimenting, and learning by doing. Over the past few years, I have developed several projects related to content creation, websites and social media, both independently and for clients, combining creativity with analytical thinking.
I consider myself a naturally curious person. I genuinely dislike ending the day without having learned something new, whether it is about finance, business, technology or productivity. This curiosity drives me to constantly explore new ideas, tools and perspectives, and to continuously improve both professionally and personally.
I approach my work with discipline, structure and long-term focus, aiming to build a versatile profile that connects finance, entrepreneurship and technology.
